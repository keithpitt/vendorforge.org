    <h4>What is Vendor?</h4>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
    <p>Vendor makes the process of using and managing libraries in iOS easy. Vendor is modeled after Bundler. Vendor streamlines the installation and update process for dependent libraries. It also tracks versions and manages dependencies between libraries.</p>
    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
    <p>Vendor works by making direct modifications to your project file. When you install a library, vendor will copy all the source files, build setting and frameworks
    to your project, then save it. That way, when you want to install a library, all you have to do is add it to your Vendorfile, and then type into your Terminal <code>vendor install</code></p>
